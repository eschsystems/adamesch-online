built my personal website as a d&d character sheet with help from claude. sometimes the best approach is to just vibe with the code and let creativity flow.

instead of overthinking the design or getting caught up in perfect architecture, i just started building what felt right. the d&d theme captures my personality perfectly - chaotic evil alignment, systems engineer class, and all the weird multiclassing that makes me who i am.

the whole thing is next.js + tailwind with a cyberpunk neon aesthetic. every section tells a story about my skills, background, and the random collection of abilities i've picked up over the years. from scuba diving to ai agents to having a fancy cat named "his royal majesty, mr. tinkles."

this is what happens when you stop worrying about conventions and just build something that makes you smile. sometimes vibe-coding is the way to go.
